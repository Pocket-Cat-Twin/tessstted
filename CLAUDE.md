1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. For each project you need to create their own [todo.md] in main direcrity of project.
8. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.


When working with my code:

1. **Think deeply** before making any edits
2. **Understand the full context** of the code and requirements
3. **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous
4. **Think from first principles** - don't make assumptions
5. **Assess refactoring after every green** - Look for opportunities to improve code structure, but only refactor if it adds value
6. **Keep project docs current** - update them whenever you introduce meaningful changes
   **At the end of every change, update CLAUDE.md with anything useful you wished you'd known at the start**.
   This is CRITICAL - Claude should capture learnings, gotchas, patterns discovered, or any context that would have made the task easier if known upfront. This continuous documentation ensures future work benefits from accumulated knowledge


### Communication

- Be explicit about trade-offs in different approaches
- Explain the reasoning behind significant design decisions
- Flag any deviations from these guidelines with justification
- Suggest improvements that align with these principles
- When unsure, ask for clarification rather than assuming

## Summary

The key is to write clean, testable, functional code that evolves through small, safe increments. Every change should be driven by a test that describes the desired behavior, and the implementation should be the simplest thing that makes that test pass. When in doubt, favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.
